Python script using selenium to login to your linkedin account and scroll down

This uses selenium to automate web broowsers.I have used the Chrome web browser. To use it you need to download the chrome webdriver.

Change the user id and password with your credentials to use the script. 
You can also change the scroll pause time according your need.
